What we did

We make a 3D adventure game where the player is a knight who needs to complete various quests assigned by NPCs in a medieval village. The quests will include finding and chasing missing pets/kids and fighting with robbers. The game is developed with Unity 3D and includes AI components such as pathfinding, decision-making, state machine, etc. 

how it works

Open Unity and choose [the scene], and play around with it.

what went well

We basically achieved everything we proposed in our final proposal 

what went poorly

Time is tight, so the game has many spaced to be improved
