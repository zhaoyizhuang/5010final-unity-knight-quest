### What we did

We make a 3D adventure game where the player is a knight who needs to complete various quests assigned by NPCs in a medieval village. The quests will include finding and chasing missing pets/kids and fighting with robbers. The game is developed with Unity 3D and includes AI components such as pathfinding, decision-making, state machine, etc. 

### How it works

Open Unity and choose [the scene], and play around with it.

### What went well

We basically achieved everything we proposed in our final proposal 

### What went poorly

Time is tight, so the game has many spaced to be improved
